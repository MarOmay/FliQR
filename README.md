FliQR is a Qr code generating system that's main purpose is to facilitate offline contactless form answering and reports generation.

Creating a form is as simple as identifying the fields that will be answered.

Once done, a QR code can be generated and saved for later use.

This action also generates an Excel file where responses can be recorded.

The forms can be accessed by either scanning the QR code through the app, or importing an image that conatins the Qr code.

Below is a sample of how to form looks like on the end of the one answering the form.

Afterwards, a Qr code can be generated that can be scanned by the facilitator to record the respone.
